# Apparate: Rethinking Early Exits to Tame Latency-Throughput Tensions in ML Serving

This repository contains the source code implementation of the [SOSP '24](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/sosp/2024/) paper [Apparate: Rethinking Early Exits to Tame Latency-Throughput Tensions in ML Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05385). 
#### Note that the arxiv version is not up to date to our SOSP submission, we will update the arxiv paper after camera ready.

## Getting Started

Apparate is implemented in Python. We have tested Apparate on Ubuntu 22.04 with Python 3.8.13.

Detailed instructions on how to reproduce the main results from our SOSP paper are in [EXPERIMENTS.md](EXPERIMENTS.md).
